# Detection Engineering and Development

I'm not a big fan of the term `detection engineering`, as I'm of the opinion that you're not an engineer unless you earned an [iron ring](https://youtu.be/fYn9C_ixIPA?si=Fai8zsNsPKZCTKko) (I'm Canadian) or at least made something **physical**, or completed a degree in software engineering.

Writing text files doesn't make you an engineer.

But I get the meaning behind it so let's continue.
